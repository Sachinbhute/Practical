    <h2>Michael Faraday</h2>
  </div>
  
    <div class="ndiv">
     <p>Michael Faraday, (born September 22, 1791, Newington, Surrey,
      England—died August 25, 1867, Hampton Court, Surrey),
      English physicist and chemist whose many experiments 
      contributed greatly to the understanding of electromagnetism.
      Faraday, who became one of the greatest scientists of the 19th 
      century, began his career as a chemist. He wrote a manual of practical 
      chemistry that reveals his mastery of the technical aspects of his art, 
      discovered a number of new organic compounds, among them benzene, and was 
      the first to liquefy a “permanent” gas (i.e., one that was believed to be 
      incapable of liquefaction).</p>

         <p>Michael Faraday was born in the country village of Newington, Surrey,
          now a part of South London. His father was a blacksmith who had migrated 
          from the north of England earlier in 1791 to look for work. His mother was 
          a country woman of great calm and wisdom who supported her son emotionally
          through a difficult childhood. Faraday was one of four children, all of whom
          were hard put to get enough to eat, since their father was often ill and incapable
          of working steadily. </p>

        <div class="sdiv">
          <p>Faraday later recalled being given one loaf of bread that had to last him for a week. 
          The family belonged to a small Christian sect, called Sandemanians, that provided spiritual 
          sustenance to Faraday throughout his life. It was the single most important influence upon him 
          and strongly affected the way in which he approached and interpreted nature.</p>
