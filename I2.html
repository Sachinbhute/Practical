    <h2>Sir Issac Newton</h2>
  </div>
  
    <div class="ndiv">
     <p>Sir Isaac Newton PRS (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27[a]) was an English
      mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author (described in his
      time as a "natural philosopher") widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians
      and physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists. He was a key figure
      in the philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis
      Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687,
      established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares
      credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus.</p>

       <div class="kdiv">
         <p>In Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the 
         dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his
         mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides,
         the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about 
         the Solar System's heliocentricity. He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial 
         bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate 
         spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, 
         convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.</p>

        <div class="sdiv">
          <p>Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour 
          based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. 
          His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published in 1704. He also 
          formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, 
          and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician 
          Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, 
          developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves.</p>
